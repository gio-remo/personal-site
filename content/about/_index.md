Ciao! Hallo! Hej!

I'm Giovanni and I'm an Economics Master's student at the [Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit√§t](https://www.en.master.econ.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) in Munich.

I obtained my BSc degree in Economics at the [University of Milan](https://ema.cdl.unimi.it/it) in July 2022, with the [thesis](https://github.com/gio-remo/Personal-Materials/tree/main/BSc-Thesis-Econ): _"Climateflation: Climate Change drives Inflation"_.

After the library, I like running and playing 70s songs on my guitar. My ideal Sunday? Hiking in the Bavarian mountains.
