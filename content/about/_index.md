Ciao! Hallo! Hej!

I'm Giovanni and I'm an Economics Master's student at the [Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität](https://www.en.master.econ.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) in Munich.

I obtained my BSc degree in Economics at the [University of Milan](https://ema.cdl.unimi.it/it) in July 2022, with the [thesis](https://github.com/gio-remo/Personal-Materials/tree/main/BSc-Thesis-Econ): _"Climateflation: Climate Change drives Inflation"_.

After the library, I like running and playing 70s songs on my guitar. My ideal Sunday? Hiking in the Bavarian mountains.

This is a list of my own works that I have written for my studies over the years.

In the last few decades, the global landscape of corporate income taxation has witnessed a significant transformation characterized by a widespread decline in tax rates levied on corporate profits. Understanding what is driving reductions
in tax levels and the effects on government revenues is crucial for designing effective tax policies and ensuring sustainable fiscal frameworks.

<b>✽ Climateflation: Climate Change Drives Inflation</b><br>
<div style="font-size: 80%;padding:7px 0 15px;">June 2022 | Bachelor's Thesis | <a href="https://github.com/gio-remo/own-works/tree/main/BSc-Thesis-Econ" target="_blank">Source</a> | <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bdvXAqRCsU1Ujff233XGavilWQuQF6oW/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">PDF</a></div>
Human activity is responsible for climate change, with both direct and indirect effects. Inflation is out of control, and central banks struggle to maintain targets, as a result of a combination of factors, some of which are not under their direct control. One might believe that these two phenomena are traveling on parallel tracks, but as it turns out, they actually interfere with each other.
