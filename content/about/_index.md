Ciao! Hallo! Hej!

I'm Giovanni and I'm an Econ student interested in macroeconomic, monetary and economic policy topics.

After library, I like running, but I'm a runner who has never run a race. So, finding a good one to accomplish is currently in my to-do-list. Meanwhile, I'm hiking in the Bavarian mountains.

Second hand, sustainable lifestyle and diet should be very common topics to everyone nowadays. These themes fill my days.
