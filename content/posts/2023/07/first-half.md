The first half of my master's degree here in Munich is finished. I can't even imagine how many more things could happen in the second one.

Above all, I really enjoyed taking the exam on the Economics of Climate Change and writing my first seminar paper on Corporate Tax Competition and Revenue Effects. Meanwhile, my experience at ISTO is letting me know amazing people.

But now, it's time for a (short) break. Please, "wake me up when September ends"!
