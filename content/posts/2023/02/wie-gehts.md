Wie geht's? Danke, gut! Und dir?

Since moving to Munich seven months ago (!!), I have been studying some basics of **German** on my own.

Living in the city and just speaking English is not a big difficulty, but occasionally I've run into situations where it would have been nice to be able to communicate in German.
So, during this semester break, I'm taking my first German language course (A1.1) at the Münchner Volkshochschule.

My goal? Being able to order the full menu in German at the next Oktoberfest!

Tschüs, bis bald!
