When my parents tell me about their educational and professional background, I am astonished at how different 40 years ago the world and society looked like. Higher education was a privilege for a few. Today, I am happy and thankful to live in a **European** country where higher education is (almost) accessible for everyone. A lot is still to be done, but I am convinced that University, and the research conducted in it, is the place where our future lies.

I graduated in Economics and Management from the Università degli Studi di Milano, but this is just the beginning because _"a smooth sea never made a skilled sailor"_.

Let me thank my **family** for their unconditional support and the values they taught me. Then, my **friends**, always able to make me happy.
