It's been a month since I moved to Munich, Germany. A few years ago, I never thought I would have the chance to live the **European dream**.

For me, graduation has been a re-start and the opportunity to look beyond. In 2020, I was supposed to go on Erasmus with an Erasmus scholarship at the University of Zagreb, Croatia, but the pandemic ruined my plans. However, it didn't destroy my desire to be a European citizen even before being an Italian.

Today I live in a European city rich in culture, nature and opportunities. Being European means not only "being able to travel easily", but first and foremost being **free and united**, as in Altiero Spinelli's vision.

New adventures, adversities, dreams and people are out there waiting for me. Gotta go, bye!
