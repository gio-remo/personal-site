Today is ended my 3-months experience as a supply teacher at my former high school, the ITIS Pietro Paleocapa in Bergamo.

<!--more-->

Working as a teacher at 21 made me conscious of some things. Teachers love their job, even though some of them hide this feeling. They are good listeners, observers and, more important, experts on their subjects.

I won't forget "my" students, their questions and the funny moments. During these months I grew up with them. In my last lessons, **I wished them to find their own happiness**, to study and work hard for it, because outside school there are no shortcuts. (Good luck everyone!)

I wanna say thank you to all my ex-teachers (now colleagues) for the tips and the small talks in the hallways, they were "refreshing".

Every time I walked into the corridors that just 3 years ago I left, I couldn't not think about my classmates and our adventures. I miss it.

These 3-months felt like coming back home.
