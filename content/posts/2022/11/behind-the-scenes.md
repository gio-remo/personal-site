It's now online my personal website/blog/archive/whatever.

Here are some details behind the scenes. The site follows the **Jamstack** approach. This means the pages are pre-built and served directly by a CDN, resulting in better performances (100% GTmetrix) and in a fewer demand for resources. To do so, I chose **Hugo** as site generator. The whole is hosted on GitHub in a private repo. Then, I linked the repo to Netlify, which takes care of actually pre-building the files and deploying them through its CDNs. Finally, I bought the domain from Google Domains and linked my new domain to the site generated by Netlify. The images are hosted on Cloudinary, which transforms them and serves a webp version.

The site will be always a "work in progress". The following step is to include a section for my investments.
