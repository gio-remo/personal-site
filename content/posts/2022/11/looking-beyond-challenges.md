Mental health topics are slowly getting the attention they deserve, and an open dialogue about them may always benefit people in need.

So, how am I doing? Well, it's an **emotional rollercoaster**!

I am living what I have always craved! Living and studying abroad in a renowned university, surrounded by tons of international other students (and gradually connecting with them), sharing my daily life with wonderful flatmates and discovering a new country and its culture. "What else?"

The reality is that we are all human beings with **emotions** facing **difficulties**. In the last weeks, I sometimes felt sad, lonely, stressed and not good (enough). To get through these moments, I slowed down and became conscious of my emotions, or I started doing something I enjoy (running or cooking!).

Sounds strange after what I've just written, but I'm definitely having a good time here in Munich: full of opportunities, joyful moments, wonderful people surrounding me, and some positive struggles. I know also that Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München has a lot to teach me and that, in the end, all my efforts will be worth it.

Daje!
